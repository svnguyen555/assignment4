    <h1>Learning Japanese</h1>
        <p>
            I've been learning Japanese for 5 years now. Last year I earned a certifcate that proves that I have a business level understanding of the lanaguage.<br>
            According to the JLPT Website, the passrate for getting that certificate is around less than 40%.<br>
            Here is a textbook I used to learn Japanese from scratch:
